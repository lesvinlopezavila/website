    i love dogs by janeth
    <h1>
i love fights
i like fights because  i get to see them and learn how to defend my self  
and help ppl on things so they could learn from me and be strong .
and i love dogs because they are cute and playfull with you and can make
people be out of eletronics and have fun with them , u can take them on 
out out side with them and u can have conpuny and they dont make u feel sad or mad.
